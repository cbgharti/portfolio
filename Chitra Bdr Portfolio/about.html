      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Chitra Bahadur Gharti. Originally from Baglung, Nepal, I am currently pursuing my higher education in Information Technology at a university in Australia. My academic journey has been fueled by a curiosity for technology and a desire to make meaningful contributions to the digital world.
        Web development has been a passion of mine for several years. I have honed my skills in languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and technologies to expand my knowledge base. My goal is to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences that leave a lasting impact.
        Beyond the realm of academia and technology, I lead an active lifestyle. Basketball is not just a sport for me; it's a passion that has taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and discipline. Whether it's playing pickup games with friends or participating in local leagues, I find joy and fulfillment on the court.
        In addition to sports, I also have a penchant for online gaming. Games like Free Fire allow me to unwind and connect with friends in virtual worlds filled with excitement and strategy. The competitive nature of gaming fuels my desire for continuous improvement and strategic thinking.
        Moreover, I'm passionate about photography. Capturing moments, whether it's the vibrant street life of a new city or the serene beauty of nature, allows me to express my creativity and perspective. Through the lens, I find inspiration and a means to share stories with others.
        As I continue my journey in Australia, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in web development to real-world projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
